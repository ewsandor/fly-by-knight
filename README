REWRITE IN PROGRESS 
The 'master' branch of this repository is no longer maintained.  All active development is currently on the 'rewrite' branch.  Once the rewrite is on par functionally, it will be slammed to the 'master' branch.

	Fly By Knight is an amateur chess engine currently implementing the xboard/winboard chess protocol.  The code is written in C++.  Main development and support is for the x86_64 Linux Kernel.  The code is written as portable as possible for easy porting to Windows and other kernels.

	To use the opening book, copy "book.fbk" into the directory Fly By Knight is run from.  After every game, if result is sent (e.g. 'result 1-0 {White mates.}'), Fly By Knight will record the result to the book.  After enough games are played moves may be based from the book.

	- Requires g++ to compile with Make
	- Depends on the POSIX pthread library
	- Simply type 'make' to compile.
	- To run with the command line interface type 'make run'
	- If xboard is installed, the engine can be run with xboard by typing 'make runxboard'
